**I'm Toast!**

I'm a lone developer. I started my programming journy in python back in 2016 I was on and off willing to do things. Around 2021-2022 I published my first repo a python discord bot to my github.
Did a little bit of html, and swift in between. I then found my way to Java and miencraft, but I didnt stick with Java for long as Kotlin just hit me better.
